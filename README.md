## Problem1 
Kth largest in Array (https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-an-array/)

Find the kth largest element in an unsorted array. Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

Example 1:

Input: [3,2,1,5,6,4] and k = 2

Output: 5

Example 2:

Input: [3,2,3,1,2,4,5,5,6] and k = 4

Output: 4

Note:
You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ array's length.

## Problem2

Merge k Sorted Lists(https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-k-sorted-lists/)

Merge k sorted linked lists and return it as one sorted list. Analyze and describe its complexity.

Example:

Input:
[
  1->4->5,
  1->3->4,
  2->6
]
Output: 1->1->2->3->4->4->5->6
